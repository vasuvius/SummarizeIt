## 1. What it is:

SummarizeIt is a google chrome extension that summarizes any text. Highlight any text, fire up the SummarizeIt extension and it will summarize the text in under a second. 

## 2. How I built it:

I built using React. The summaries are generated using OpenAi's GPT-3 Davinci model. The powerful AI generates text based on an input. SummarizeIt uses TL:DR; (Too Long: Didn't Read) which is a capability of GPT-3. TL:DR; generates sumarries of input text which I then display in the SummarizeIt chrome extension.

## 2. How to build this extension:

```
$ yarn run build
```

## 3. How to add it to your Chrome browser:
